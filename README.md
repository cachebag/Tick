## Features

- Calendar: [â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘] 90%
    - Still a few formatting issues
    - Home view still needs a statistics section showing (and appending to the database) finished, in progress and total tasks for the current year
    - Need to fix/implement keybindngs for navigation
    - Would like to implement a markdown viewer for the notes in the day view. Still trying to figure out the best way to implement this
- Database: [â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ] 100%
    - Schema is set and easily scalable
    - Still would be a good idea to implement data imports; allowing the user to move their .db file between devices
- Nest+:    [â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘] 55%
    - Still a good amount of formatting issues
    - Keybinding/Focus issues. Implemntations for vim motions are setup nicely, but general program navigation and UX needs some work.
    - Need better save, file creation/deletion and navigation for the directory tree
    - Embed a markdown viewer for .md files
    - Need a clean and easy to read, built in guide to help users navigate the code editor and other program keybinds
- Pomodoro: [â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘] 0%
    - This shouldn't be too hard
- Spotify:  [â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘â–‘] 0%
    - Neither should this, but need to think more about how to implement this exactly...
      - Concurrency in music playing while navigating program
      - Full features or something simpler like playlists only, liked songs, etc.
      - OAUth implementation
