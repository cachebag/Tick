# tick ðŸ“¼

**Tick** is a lightweight, command-line-based task and productivity manager built in Python. It's been developed for my personal use throughout my University courses. 

## TODO
- Fix timeout issues when adding assignments/tasks within weeks.
- Refactor code and clean up the mess I have made in `main.py`.
- Currently, data is stored in memory and doesn't persist between sessions. This comes after refactoring the code.
