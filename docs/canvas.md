- For the Canvas URL, it is simply the URL from your Canvas home page. For example: https://canvas.college-name.edu/ - This is typically the format for all Universities that use Canvas.

- Once you are in, you will be met with your courses and your grades for the current semester on the top left, a list of your upcoming assignments and the due date on the bottom right, and a list of all recent announcements on the right, formatted in Markdown.
