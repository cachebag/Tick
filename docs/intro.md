# Tick 
Let's talk about why Tick was made and who it's for.

## Productivity apps always leave something to be desired 
I just think they're all missing something. I can download a million calendar apps, todolist apps, but I haven't found something that has everything that I need, which in my case, is a simple task manager, pomodoro timer, spotify music and a place to write some notes and code.

Most that I've used tend to have been student projects, or a quick way to practice some CRUD which is absolutely valid and commendable. There's nothing wrong with that. But I'd really like something that I can use for the entirety of my degree and perhaps beyond.

## My goal
I have had an addiction to media for a long time. It is very hard for me to sit down and study in front of a computer without googling something random, opening a YouTube video, or browsing reddit. And although this is not the root of my problem, I've found that I tend to jump between apps so constantly, especially during a study session, that it becomes increasingly easy for me to allow my brain to take me places I shouldn't go.

I have seen this issue in a lot of other students as well. So my goal with this program is to condense everything a student would need (typically STEM) into one producitivy app and confine them to the terminal nonetheless, so that hopefully, the urge to jump to distractions is decreased. Additionally, I do think it's especially nice for CS/ENG stuents to become comfortable with their terminals, even if this doesn't do that in the traditional sense. 

## What is Tick
My initial version of this was actually built over ncurses using C, then pycurses using Python and although I liked the abstracted nature of the code after switching from C, I think that pycurses was a little too esoteric for my taste. I wanted something that could just let me build what I want, in the shortest time possible.

That's when I found [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io) when browsing HackerNews. I took one look at the types of programs that could be built with it, and I was instantly hooked. 

Developing in Textual has been an absolulute blast. I joined their Discord after wanting to show off the [NeoVim plugin I made to support syntax highlighting for their .tcss file format](https://github.com/cachebag/nvim-tcss), and though their community is fairly small, they are a super helpful and enthusiastic bunch of developers who welcome you in open arms when it comes to talking about or needing help with Textual.
 
## Yap over
Okay, sorry for all of that. I do love you if you read through it, but go ahead and look through the docs to see how to develop, use and take advantage of Tick's features.
